C++ Othello

---------------------------------
About:
    This is a command-line version of Othello written in C++.
    It has an AI that can run in time-limited and depth-limited search modes.

Compilation:
    Compile using g++

    On Windows, you need MinGW. Install it and add the bin folder to your path.
    On Linux, you're set.

    Go to the folder and type g++ othello.cpp

Arguments:
    -m #
            Sets the play mode.
            0 = manual; 1 = randomly select a move;
            2 = always select first move; 3 = AI controlled.
    -f
            If set, the opponent will get the first move. Otherwise, the player will go first.
    -d #
            Sets the AI search depth. If 0, the AI will select a depth based on the current move number.
            If -1, the AI will randomly pick moves.
    -t #
            Sets the AI search timeout, in seconds. The AI will stop calculating a move if
            it exceeds this time.
    -T
            Sets AI to time-limited mode. If set, the AI will continue to increase the
            search depth until it runs out of time.
    -c
            If set, the screen will be cleared after each turn.
    -v #
            Sets the verbosity. A higher number will be more verbose.
    -h
            Displays the help message.

Testing:
    To run the test suite, from the main directory do the following:
        $ tests\test.bat

    This will run the tests listed in tests/tests.lst and output the results to the output directory.
    Note that the test suite requires awk.

    You can diff the results against the expected results by doing
        $ tests\diff.bat

    This will diff each of the files in the output directory with the corresponding file in the expected 
    directory using vim diff.
